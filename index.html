I enjoy deriving meaning from data using mathematical and statistical modeling, with an integral part of that process being able to explain results in actionable and meaningful terms to stakeholders. An ability to self-start, think on my feet, understand complex relationships, and excitement for the financial markets drives my passion for applying my talents in the financial services industry. Upon graduation, I am hoping to pursue the CFA and CAIA. Beyond understanding learning more about market trends and relevant skills, my personal hobbies include playing SpikeBall, golfing, skiing, reading, and spending time outdoors. I‘m also learning how to play the guitar.

          <h1>What My Bosses Have Said</h1>
          <blockquote> Liam is a self-learner who always welcomes tough analytical challenges. For example, when
            working with R Programming on a difficult data problem, he identifies online resources on his
            own and doesn’t stop working on the problem until the work is completed at a good quality. He
            is also an articulate communicator who understands the importance of listening. He is a good
            storyteller with data, always considering business needs and logical connections of the different
            data elements. I have no doubt he will be successful in his work at CS.
            <span>Name available upon request</span>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote> He has led by example by conducting himself professionally at
            all times and was always willing to go above and beyond. He could be relied upon to fulfill his work
            commitment of approximately twenty hours a week and to pick up extra hours when we needed
            additional help. I have come to rely on Liam because of his work ethic and demeanor, and he quickly became
            not just a student worker but a student leader.
            <span>Name available upon request</span>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>  Liam always conducts himself in the most professional manner and has an innate
            ability to bond with both students and professional staff when called upon for advice. I am excited that
            Liam is continuing to pursue an internship in the tech analytics field, as that was always a part of his
            future goals.
